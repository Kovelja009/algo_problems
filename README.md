## **Graphs - DFS**

### [399. Evaluate Division](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/)

Notes:
- build a graph with the given equations and values
  ```        
  for (A, B), value in zip(equations, values):
            graph[A][B] = value
            graph[B][A] = 1 / value```
- after that, just use BFS (lol) betwen start and end of the query, if the path exists, thats the solution


---
## **Heap / Priority Queue**

### [2542. Maximum Subsequence Score](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subsequence-score/)

Notes:

- firstly indeces don't need to be consecutive
- we can sort first and second array in descending order by second array
- then we keep adding elements from the first array to the priority queue
- if we have more than `k` elements in the priority queue we can remove the smallest one *(we don't need to pay attention to the order because we now for sure that anything removed from `pq` is index in the second array of the thing greater than the current element and we need smallest one anyway)*
- and when we have `k` elements we can check the result

---
### [2462. Total Cost to Hire K Workers](https://leetcode.com/problems/total-cost-to-hire-k-workers/)

Notes:

- we need to know the minimum on the left and right part in any given moment so we need 2 priority queues(`left` and `right`)
- also we need to pay attention that 2 given `pqs` are **not overlapping**

---
## **Binary Search**
### [2300. Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions](https://leetcode.com/problems/successful-pairs-of-spells-and-potions/)

Notes:

- we first sort `potions` in ascending order
- then for each `spell` we find the smallest potion that satisfies the `success` condition, after that we can just subtract the index of the potion from the length of the `potions` array
- we can do this by using **binary search**

---
### [162. Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)

Notes:
- just standard binary search
- we look for the element that has both neighbours smaller than itself
- if either of the neighbours is greater than the current element we move to the greater neighbour

---
### [875. Koko Eating Bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)

Notes:
- we can use binary search where lower limit is 1 and upper limit is the maximum number of bananas
- and we can check if the current number of bananas is enough to eat all the bananas in `piles` for <= `H` 

---
## **Backtracking**
### [17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/)
  
Notes:
- we can make backtracking function that takes the current string and the index of the current digit
- if the `index` == `len(digits)` we can add the current string to the result
- for each digit we call `backtrack` function with the current string + the current letter from the digit and the next index

---
### [216. Combination Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iii/)

Notes:
- we can make backtracking function that takes starting number and array of current numbers
- if the sum of the current numbers is equal to `k` we can add the current numbers to the result
- for each number from `start` to 9 we call the `backtrack` function where we add 'i' to the current numbers and 'i+1' is next start and after calling 'backtrack' we remove the last element from the current numbers

---
## **Dynamic Programming (1D)**
### [198. House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)

Notes:

- classic dp problem where formula is `dp[i] = max(nums[i] + dp[i-2], dp[i-1])`
- Space optimized version where we only need 2 variables to keep track of the previous 2 values and not whole dp array

---
### [790. Domino and Tromino Tiling](https://leetcode.com/problems/domino-and-tromino-tiling/)

Notes:
- when trying to figure out formula you can just run different testcases and see the result, so you can find the pattern
- here pattern was `dp[i] = dp[i-1]*2 + dp[i-3]`
- Space optimized version where we only need 3 variables

---
## **Dynamic Programming (2D)**
### [62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

Notes:
- how to know that this is dp problem? - we can see that robot can only move right and down, if it wasn't the case we would have to use something else (e.g. backtracking)
- formula is `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]` where `dp[0][0] = 1`

---
### [1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)

Notes:
- classic dp problem where formula is `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1` if `text1[i] == text2[j]` otherwise `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`

---
### [714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/)

Notes:
- different that the standard dp problem
- we initialize `cash = 0` and `stock = -prices[0]` because we can buy the stock at the first day
- for each day, we can either sell  the stock `cash=max(cash, stock + stocks[i] - fee)` or buy the new stock `stock=max(stock, cash - stocks[i])`

---
### [72. Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)

Notes:
- similar to the problem from Speech Recognition course (***Dynamic Time Warping***)
- initialize the dp matrix with the size of `len(word1)+1` and `len(word2)+1`
- cover base cases: when one of the words is `empty`, the distance is the length of the other word
- formula is:
    - if the characters are the same, `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`
    - else the characters are different, `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1`

---
## **Bit Manipulation**
### [1318. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-flips-to-make-a-or-b-equal-to-c/)

Notes:
- by doing `(a | b)` we can see the result of joining the bits of a and b. So we can then do `mask = result ^ c` to see the bits that are different from ``c`` (they need to be changed)
- also we do `mask & a & b` because if `c` is 0 and we have 1 in `a` and `b` we need to change them to 0 (both)

---
## **Trie**
### [1268. Search Suggestions System](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-suggestions-system/)
  
Notes:
- just the idea to use trie to store the words and then for each prefix we can find the words that start with that prefix
  
---
## **Intervals**
### [435. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

Notes:
- we can sort intervals by first interval, and we have marker the end of first interval
- we increase the counter if the beginning of the next interval is greater than or equal to the marker and we update the marker `marker=max(marker, end)`
- otherwise we just update the marker: `marker=min(marker, end)`
- inspiration drawn from course `DAA :)`

---
### [452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/)

Notes:
- sort intervals by the end (ascending)
- then if the start is different then `curr_end` just increase counte by 1 and update `curr_end` to the end of the current interval
- again `DAA :)`

---
## **Monotonic Stack**
### [739. Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)

Notes:
- initialize `ans` array with zeros
- push the index of the first element to the stack
- for each temperature:
  1. while temperature is greater than the temperature of the element on the top of the stack we can update the `ans` array with `ans = i - stack.top()`and pop the element from the stack
  2. add `i` to the stack
- then at the end all the remaining elements on the stack should have zero (which they do because of the initialization)

---
### [901. Online Stock Span](https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/)

Notes:
- initilize stack
- while `price` is higher than what is on the `top of the stack` we can **pop** the elements and add the `span` of that popped element to the `ans`
- once finished `ans += 1` (because current day is also counted)
- then just push `(price, ans)` to the stack
- and return `ans`

## Array/String
---
### [88. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)

Notes:
- interesting approach where we start from the end
and we have `k=m+n-1`, `i=m-1` and `j=n-1`
- why from the end -> because we don't need to insert anything just replace the values

---
### [27. Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)

Notes:
- idea is to use two pointers, one for the current element and one for the last element that is not `val`

---
### [26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

Notes:
- again two pointers approach, one for the current element and one for the first element that greater than current

---
### [80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/)

Notes:
- two pointers but interesting approack where we start for loop with `i` from the second element and `curr=2` and only update if `nums[i] != nums[curr-2]` 

---
### [169. Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)
  
Notes:
- simple use of hash table -> Space complexity O(n)- Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm can be used to reduce the space complexity to O(1)

---
### [189. Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/)
- Notes:
  1. Solution 1 (using extra space O(n)):
    - create a new array `temp`
    - do the `k = k%size` to avoid index out of range
    - then copy elements starting from index `start=size-k` to the end
    - then copy elements from the `0` to the `start`
    - then copy the `temp` to the `nums`
  2. Solution 2 (Using O(1) space):
    - reverse the whole array
    - reverse the first `k` elements
    - reverse the last `n-k` elements

---
### [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)
  
Notes:
- simple approach where we keep track of the minimum price up to this moment and based on that we save the maximum profit

---
### [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)

Notes:
- we add the profit if the price is greater than the previous one :(


---
### [55. Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)

Notes:
- at each step, we update the maximum reachable index
- and then check whether we can reach current index with the maximum reachable index
  
---
### [45. Jump Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/)

Notes:
- we keep track of the furthest we can jump
- when `i` reaches `current end` we update the `current end` with the `farthest` and increment the `jumps`

## 游릭 Easy
### [13. Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)
`hash table`

Notes:
- we use `hash table` to map the **roman characters** to the **integer values**

---
### [359. Logger Rate Limiter](https://leetcode.com/problems/logger-rate-limiter/)
`hash map`

Notes:
- just put message in the `hash map` where the value is `timestamp` and if the message is already in the `hash map` and the difference between the `timestamp` and the value is less than `10`, we return `False`, otherwise we update the `timestamp` and return `True`

---
## 游리 Medium
### [56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)
`sorting`

Notes:
- sort the intervals based on the start
- if the end of the current interval is greater than the start of the next interval, we merge them

---
### [146. LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)
`linked list` `hash table`

Notes:
- similar to what we do at the **OS course** :)
- we use `OrderedDict` that keeps track of order of elements that were added
- when getting element, we move it to the end of the list
- when adding element, if present we move it to the end, if not we add it to the end and remove the first element if the size is greater than the capacity

---
### [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)
`bfs` `dfs`

Notes:
- we did this problem in the **Algorithms** course
- when we find `grid[i][j] == '1'` we increment the count and do the BFS to mark all the connected islands as visited

---
### [15. 3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)
`two pointers`

Notes:
- discussion -> *not the 3some I wanted*
- sort the array
- for each element `nums[i]` we use two pointers `left=i+1` and `right=n-1`
- if sum is less than `0` we increment the `left`, if sum is greater than `0` we decrement the `right`, if sum is equal to `0` we add the triplet to the result
--- 
### [528. Random Pick with Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/)
`prefix sum` `binary search`

Notes:
- we first make `pdf` (*probability density function*) by dividing the weight by the sum of all weights
- then we make `cdf` (*cumulative density function*) (prefix sum)
- then for each random number we do the `binary search` to find the index of the number in the `cdf` array and return that **index**

---
### [253. Meeting Rooms II](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/)
`sorting` `heap`

Notes:
- we **sort** intervals by `start` and then `end` time 
- after that we use `heap` to keep track of the end time of the meetings
- if the `start time` of the meeting is greater than the `end time` of the meeting, we `pop` the `end time` from the `heap` and `push` the new `end time`
- otherwise we just `push` the `end time` to the `heap`

---
### [380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/)
`hash map` `list`

Notes:
- use `hashmap` in a way that `dict[val] = len(lst)-1` and `lst.append(val)`
- then when removing the element, we swap the element with the last element and `pop` the last element and also `remove` element from `hashmap`

---
### [54. Spiral Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/)
`matrix`

Notes:
- same as the problem from `UUP` course `>_<`
- make `direction array` and check whether you are in the bounds and if you are not in the bounds or you have visited the element, change the direction
---
### [17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/)
`backtracking` `hash table`

Notes:
- have done it before (I believe in the **Algorithms** course)
- we use `backtracking` by going through each letter of each digit and building `combination` after which we recursively call the function for the next digit, after that we remove the last letter from the `combination`
- we use `hash table` to map the digit to the 

---
### [394. Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/)
`stack`

Notes:
- idea is to have 2 stacks -> `letter_stack` and `digit_stack`
- first we initialize `ans = ""` and `num = ""`
- `curr.isdigit()` -> we add the digit to the `num`
- `curr == '['` -> we add the `num` to the `digit_stack` and `ans` to the `letter_stack` and reset the `num` and `ans`
- `curr == ']'` -> we pop the `num` and `letters` from the stacks and `ans = letters + num*ans`
- `curr.isalpha()` -> we add the letter to the `ans`

---
### [1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique/)
`hash map` `set`

Notes:
- we use `hash map` to count the frequency of the characters
- then we use `set` to store each frequency and if the frequency is already in the set, we decrement the frequency until it is not in the set and increment the `deletions`

---
### [210. Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/)
`topological sort` `dfs` `graph`

Notes:
- lol -> had to watch 20 min video explanation of topological sort, after which I consulted gpt for better implementation :(
- we want to to topological sort of the graph
- we can use `dfs` to find the cycle in the graph
- Steps:
    1. build the graph, initialize `visited` to `0s` and `result=[]`
    2. for each course if `visited[course] != 2` we call the `dfs` function
    3. in the `dfs` function we check if the `visited[course] == 1` meaning we have detected cycle
    4. if we haven't detected cycle we set the `visited[course] = 1` and for each `neighbour` we call the `dfs` function if `visited[neighbour] != 2`

### [1239. Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-a-concatenated-string-with-unique-characters/)
`backtrack` `bit manipulation`

Notes:
- even though the solution seems to be `dp` it is actually `backtrack`
- how to know when to use `backtrack` vs `dp`
- in this problem we need to have insight into all the previous states that we have selected so we know that current word can be added to the previous state -> that's why we can't use `dp`
- Any time the problem is naturally phrased in terms of I have a **current state** and should I take this element or not?, and answering can I take this element? **involves storing state information about the current selection**, these are clues you should use `DFS` + `backtracking`
---
## 游댮 Hard
### [42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/) 
`stack`

Notes:
- idea is that for each index we need to find the maximum height to the left and right of that index (we use stack for it)
- than answer is collecting thins for each element: `ans += min(left_max, right_max) - height[i]` if that value is greater than `0`

---
### [273. Integer to English Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-english-words/)
`math` `string`

Notes:
- interesting approach where we parse three digits at a time and convert them to the words

---
### [224. Basic Calculator](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/)
`stack`

Notes:
- we use `num_stack` and `sign_stack` to store the numbers and signs before the parenthesis
- we initialize `num = 0` and `sign = 1`
- if we encounter `(` we push the `num` and `sign` to the stacks and reset the `num` and `sign`
- if we encounter `)` we pop the `num` and `sign` from the stacks and calculate the `num = num_stack.pop() + sign_stack.pop()*num`

---
### [2035. Partition Array Into Two Arrays to Minimize Sum Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-two-arrays-to-minimize-sum-difference/)
`meet in the middle` `binary search` `combinations`

Notes:
- really hard problem -> looked at the [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-two-arrays-to-minimize-sum-difference/solutions/1513435/python-easy-explanation-meet-in-the-middle/)

- using technique called `meet in the middle`
- we split the array into two parts and for each part we calculate the sum of all the possible combinations from 1 to `n//2` elements:
  - for each `k` we make `left_k_sums` which is the sum of all combinations of `k` elements from the `left part`
  - then we make `right_k_sums` which is the sum of all combinations of `n//2 - k` elements from the `right part` (if we want to combine elements from both parts)
  - then we need to fidn what is closest sum of `n // 2 - k` elements in the right_k_sums where `target` is `half_sum - left_k_sum` using `binary search`
  - and in the end when we have both left and right sums we can calculate the difference and update the `min_diff`
